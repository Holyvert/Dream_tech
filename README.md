<h1 style=bold >FoodBox</h1> 

FoodBox is an online responsive and interactive grocery website. 
The website was built to accomodate our clientele for easy and fast 
shopping from home. The user can easily paruse the items of our store
and purchase when wanted.

The website is dynamic. A back-end subsection will be able to provide 
the administration with the clients' orders as well as modify the 
contents within the store. This allows the grocery store to grow and adjust
through time or clientele suggestion.
